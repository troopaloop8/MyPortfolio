Hello World!

This blog post is an extremely exciting accomplishment for me. Why? Well, instead of using a blogging platform such as Medium, I built this all on my own! Let me back up a bit and introduce myself.

My name is Jon Troop. I used to be a Teacher of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). After graduating from University with a Communications and East Asian Studies degree in the midst of the economic crisis, I was at a loss for how to apply my degree to getting a job. I ended up teaching English for the JET program in Japan for two years, and liked it enough to pursue teaching as my career. To that end, I got a master&#39;s degree in TESOL and worked in the public school system for six years in the US teaching ESL, English, History and Creative Writing. While rewarding at first, the dysfunctional educational system and demands of being an overworked and under-supported teacher caused me to burn out, hard. I always told myself that if I ever became a teacher who had no passion, I would quit because it wasn&#39;t fair to students or to the taxpayers. So I quit.

I did a lot of soul searching after making my decision. Gaming, technology, 3-D printing, and blockchain were always the things that captured my imagination the most. Whenever I had spare time, I would be making things with my printer, reading up on technology news, gaming and playing dungeons and dragons (using my 3D printed minis) with my friends, and diving deep into the blockchain world. Whenever I was teaching, I would research the latest literature, but it always felt forced. In contrast, for tech-related topics, <strong>it is what I wanted to research</strong>. With my passion hitting me in the face, it finally dawned on me that if I want to be involved in and contribute to the tech field, then learning how to code would be the most fitting career path to take.

Starting in late 2018, I began to teach myself coding. I signed up for udemy classes and started getting the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. I made a static marketing website to demonstrate my learnings. I was happy with it. Just as I was getting going, my father in-law died the day we found out my wife was pregnant with our second child, and the resulting turbulence really knocked me off track. Eventually I got back on the horse and re-learned all the JS I forgot, but I was stuck. Hitting a wall, I ended up in tutorial hell. Frustrated with my lack of progress, I stumbled on Lambda School and decided to go for it. Now I have been enrolled part time since October 2019, and in the past 5 months, the breadth and depth of my skills has increased substantially.

One of the projects for Lambda students is to make a portfolio website. I knew I could easily write some HTML and CSS to make a beautiful page, but since it was stuff I had done dozens of times before, I thought doing that again would be a squandered opportunity to expand my skillset. We had just learned React basics, and I thought that making a page via React would be a good way to practice my newly learned skills. Digging through the documentation, I came across GatsbyJS and after watching a couple tutorial videos, I managed to create this website with GatsbyJS and React, and in the process, learned graphql which enabled me to make the database for the blog component to my website! Just a few months ago, I would have been overwhelmed to undertake such a project. Now, making a client-side site utilizing databases via React and GatsbyJS is no longer a daunting endeavor.

Going forward, this blog will act as a regular journal of the new things I am learning via Lambda and where I will share any side projects I work on. I plan to post detailed information with regards to the content of what I am learning, so if you are trying to get into coding, hopefully this blog will be a valuable resource for you in your journey to learn programming.
